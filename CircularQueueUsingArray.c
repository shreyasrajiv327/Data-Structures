/* Viva Q: Is this type of declarion "void enQueue"(void);" required?
Answer: Though this type of declarion is technically the correct way to declare, it is implicit in most compilers. Therefore "void enQueue();" is enough.
 Note: In certain compilers it gives a warning "This type of declaration is not a prototype". Fix it by adding the explicit "void" inside the function bracket.

int myCQ[SIZE]; //Array implementation of Circular Queues

/* Viva Q: What is the advantage of Circular Queues?
 Answer: Once "int myCQ[SIZE];" Queue delcaration is done, SIZE *2 , memory cannot be used for any other programs.
In tbis case 5*2 = 10 continuous memory locations are locked and fixed for the "myCQ" array.
In a Linear Queue,every deletion of the element in Queue moves "front" to the next index.
Hence the size of the Queue appears shrunk.
E.g. "myQ[0] and myQ[1] is deleted means "front" points to 2.Only 3 more array slots are available in this linesr Q.
But, in reality, the memory space for myQ[0] and myQ[1] are available.
Only, the logic for Linear Queue makes them inaccessible for inserting elements.
Circular Queues solves this problem by shifting "rear = -1".
This is when "if(rear == SIZE-1 && front != 0)" is encountered in euQueue function.
This means it makes the deleted elements position available for new insertions to heppen.
In this example myQ[0] and myQ[1] becomes freed up for new elements to be inserted.*/


int front = -1;
int rear = -1;

/* NOTE: Viva Q: Is "int front, rear = -1;" a valid declaration?
Answer: Yes it is. This is called declaration and initialization in the same line
Caution: This may not work in some cases.
Reason: In some compilers it declares "front" and "rear" as integers. But initialises only "rear" to -1.
"front" may in some cases get initialized to 0, which is incorrect in our case.*/

     Answer: There are two conditions for the Circular q to be full:
    a) Enqueing made front = 0 and rear to keep on incrementing till max limit of Queue. No dequeue happened meanwhile
     Note: This is the first part of the "if" statement "(front == 0 && rear == SIZE - 1)" where front <= rear
    b) Enqueing and dequeing happens parallely
     Note: This is the second part of the "if" statement "(front == rear+1)" where "front" is one more than "rear"
    E.g front = 0 rear 5, all elements inserted.
    Start dequeing,front = 1 meaning cQueue[0] is free. rear made 0. cQueue[0] enqueued with value inserted
    dequeue again : front = 1 rear = 0. At this situation Q is full since cQueue[0] is inserted with value previously

        To tackle the case when Enqueing and dequeing happens parallely
        E.g front = 0 rear 4, all elements inserted. Start dequeing,front = 1 meaning cQueue[0] is free
        rear = 4, front = 1. Now rear has to be shifted to freed position. So rear = -1, so that ++rear will make it 0
